Welcome to a simulation of the Monty Hall Problem in JavaScript. It allows exploring concepts in probability, statistics, and programming:

- **Probability**: Explore which decisions have the highest chances of winning. This puzzle often challenges initial thoughts on probability.

- **Statistics**: Observe how the average rate of winning changes with the number of simulations and how this is related to the probability of winning.

- **Programming**: This simulation uses JavaScript and can be easily edited. [View the code](https://github.com/johngeer/simulation-of-monty-hall-problem/blob/main/public/main.js) to see how it works or experiment with changes in your browser.
